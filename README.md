# Web Automation Final Project - Juan David Camacho G

### Initial Considerations
- This is the repo for the Web Automation Final Project stated in the POM Practice.
- Multiple type of locators were used in order to further practice these
- All 3 tests were written in the same class file given that they are only 3, making easier to understand & debug
- A priority was assigned to each test in order for them to run in the order that they were listed on the document

> [!NOTE]
> You will have to change the chromedriver location on line 11 of **TheDriver** class in ***utils***.

> [!WARNING]
> This tests were executed on my PC using the latest available version of JDK, you might need to change this on the POM for the tests to run correctly. 

### Structure
The Page Object Model structure & implementation of Page Factory of this project was based off of [the repo](https://github.com/FelipeJB/WikipediaAutomation) provided to us.
